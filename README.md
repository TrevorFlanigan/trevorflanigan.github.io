# 👋 Introduction

This prototype draws from publicly available information, more specifically the 2016 Census Canada and 2016 T1 datasets, and makes them accessible through a user-friendly interactive map. This application allows users to consume, interpret and analyze data based on parameters that are relevant to them such as: age, income and geography. This solution acknowledges that in many cases nonprofits and charities do not have the necessary tools or expertise to interpret raw data, so it aims to make the data comprehensible for users without a data science background. With this information organizations will be able to improve their decision making process regarding programming and services in areas such as fundraising, recruiting staff and allocation of resources.
